        <p><strong>1. Analysis of the text “Money as a means or an end” (Aristotle and Epicurus)</strong></p>
        <p>Money was created as a means to facilitate exchanges between people. For Aristotle, its purpose was to serve a good life, not to dominate it. Using money as a means means seeing it as a tool to satisfy real needs such as food, shelter, education or rest. When money becomes an end, it governs our lives, creates empty desires, and distances us from what truly matters. Aristotle values virtue and the good life above wealth. Epicurus believes that true happiness comes from meeting basic needs and cultivating friendship, serenity, and thoughtful living.</p>
        <p><em>Answers:</em><br>
        a) Its original purpose was to serve as a means of exchange.<br>
        b) As a means, money is a tool; as an end, it becomes an obsession.<br>
        c) Consequences: dependence, anxiety, loss of freedom, empty desires.<br>
        d) Aristotle values virtue; Epicurus values friendship, serenity, and reflection.<br>
        e) Happiness comes from simplicity and essential needs.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Reflection: To consume or to be</strong></p>
        <p>We live surrounded by messages that tell us what to buy and how to live. Advertising and social networks shape our desires. Consuming does not always mean living better. Fromm distinguishes “having” from “being”: identity based on possessions creates dependence, while “being” leads to deeper happiness. Conscious consumption means choosing freely what genuinely benefits us.</p>
        <p><em>Answers:</em><br>
        a) Needs are essential; desires are often created by marketing.<br>
        b) Money gives freedom when used wisely, but dependence when it controls us.<br>
        c) “The role of money in my life”: Money is a tool to fulfill real needs, but it should not define who I am.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Ethics of consumption and responsibility (Class 2)</strong></p>
        <p>Responsible consumers think before acting: questioning whether we truly need what we want, considering how products are made, and reflecting on the consequences our decisions have on society and the planet. Conscious consumption is not about avoiding pleasure but choosing with purpose.</p>
        <p><em>Answers:</em><br>
        1. We are not fully free, since advertising influences us.<br>
        2. Conscious consumption means thinking before buying and considering impact.<br>
        3. Yes, we can be happier with fewer things.<br>
        4. Concept map: needs vs. desires, impact, responsibility, ethics, Kant, Fromm, Epicurus.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Bilingual campaign</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Spanish message:</strong> “Choosing consciously to live better: responsible consumption makes us freer.”<br>
        <strong>English message:</strong> “Choose consciously to live better: responsible consumption makes us freer.”</p>

        <p><em>Philosophical meaning:</em> Kant (dignity), Fromm (being), Epicurus (simplicity).<br>
        <em>Linguistic explanation:</em> Simple structure, clear meaning.<br>
        <em>Design:</em> Green/blue colors, simple images, symbols of freedom.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>5. Oral presentation (summary)</strong></p>
        <p>We chose the values of responsibility and freedom in consumption. The campaign is inspired by Kant, Fromm, and Epicurus. The translation is simple and clear. We learned that conscious consumption gives freedom and leads to a more authentic and sustainable life.</p>
